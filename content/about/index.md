Hello, my name is Andre  

I'm a consultant software engineer, and I have helped many clients all over the world to build their
ETL/ELT pipelines, data warehouses, systems intregrations, automation tools, among other things.  

My primary interests are data engineering, data science, cloud, devops and backend development. Outside 
of work I like going to the gym and drinking spiced chai.
